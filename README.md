# :brain:  Neural Networks and Deep Learning

These are some of the projects from my Neural Networks class (`CSC-329`) at Union College. Each folder goes through the project description.
Most of the datasets are from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.

> You may use these code as examples with proper citation.

>  üóíÔ∏è Most projects were done individually except some projects have collaborators for testing different models.
